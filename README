TVCalendar: Add your favorite shows to your calendar.

This script gets your favorite shows from TheTVDB and creates an .ical file with the next airdates. 
You can try the script at http://happylinks.nl/TVC/index.php?accountid=[your account identifier]

You can import that url into your calender programs.(iPhone and Google Calender are tested and work)

If you want to host the script yourself:

To use this script you will have to create a API Key on http://thetvdb.com
Put this key in apicode.txt and place it in the projectfolder next to index.php
Then call the page like: index.php?accountid=
where accountid is your unique Account Identifier. You can find this in your Account tab on TheTVDB.
